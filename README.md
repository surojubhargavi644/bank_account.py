#  Bank Account Management System (OOP in Python)

##  Project Overview
This project is a Python-based **Bank Account Management System** developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It simulates real banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing funds, and adding interest for savings accounts.

The goal of this project is to understand and apply core OOP concepts in a practical way.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.13.9
- VS Code

##  OOP Concepts Used
- Class & Object
- Constructor (`__init__`)
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Method Overriding
- Polymorphism

##  Project Structure

## Features
- Create bank accounts
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Display account details
- Savings account with interest calculation
- Multiple account objects
- Real-world banking simulation

##  How the Program Works
1. A `BankAccount` class is created with attributes and methods.
2. A `SavingsAccount` class inherits from `BankAccount`.
3. Encapsulation is implemented using protected variables.
4. Interest calculation is added by overriding methods.
5. Multiple objects are created to simulate different users.

##  How to Run the Project
1. Open VS Code
2. Create a file named `bank_account.py`
3. Copy and paste the code into the file
4. Run the program using:

##  Sample Operations
- Deposit ₹2000
- Withdraw ₹1500
- Add interest to savings account
- Display updated balances

##  Learning Outcome
- Strong understanding of Python OOP concepts
- Practical experience with real-world scenarios
- Improved coding structure and reusability
